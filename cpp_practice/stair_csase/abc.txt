# This is a simple Makefile for a main program.  This
# Typing 'make' or 'make main' will create the executable file.
#

# define some Makefile variables for the compiler and compiler flags
# to use Makefile variables later in the Makefile: $()
#
#  -g    adds debugging information to the executable file
#  -Wall turns on most, but not all, compiler warnings
#
# for C++ define  CC = g++
CC = g++
CXXFLAGS = -std=c++17 -Wall
LDFLAGS = 

# typing 'make' will invoke the first target entry in the file 
# (in this case the default target entry)
# you can name this target entry anything, but "default" or "all"
# are the most commonly used names by convention
all: main

# To create the executable file main we need the source file main.cpp:
main: main.cpp
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o main main.cpp
     
# To start over from scratch, type 'make clean'.  This
# removes the executable file, as well as old .o object
# files and *~ backup files:
#
clean: 
     $(RM) main *.o *~
